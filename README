# Instalation
If you have `cargo` installed, running `cargo install chimg` should work
straightforwardly. I will try and make this more accessible to non-Rust-users
in the future.

# Setup
Copy the file `.cohost.json.example` from the git repository to `.cohost.json`
and fill in your own information. Right now you have to store your password in
plaintext, sorry. If you can't find the example file, `.cohost.json` should
look like this:
  {
      "email": "eggbug@example.com",
      "password": "hunter2",
      "page": "hi_im_eggbug"
  }

# Usage
Invoke the tool with `chimg FILE` where `FILE` is the path to the image you
would like to upload. Make sure `.cohost.json` is in your current working
directory. The output will be a URL which can be used to embed your image in
another post.

Once the image is embedded in a published or saved post, it is safe to delete
the original draft created by chimg. But there's no harm in keeping it around
beyond cluttering your drafts.
